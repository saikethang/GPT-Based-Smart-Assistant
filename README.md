# Voice-Controlled Assistant with OpenAI's GPT

## Project Overview
This project is an interactive **voice-controlled assistant** powered by OpenAI's GPT model. It allows users to issue voice commands, which are processed using natural language understanding, and receive spoken responses. The assistant provides a seamless and intuitive experience through speech recognition, text-to-speech conversion, and basic web browsing functionality.

## Features
- **Speech Recognition**: Captures audio commands and converts them into text.
- **Natural Language Processing**: Utilizes OpenAI's GPT model to interpret and generate meaningful responses.
- **Text-to-Speech Conversion**: Converts text responses into audio output for the user.
- **Web Browsing**: Opens specific websites based on user voice commands.
