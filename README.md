The assistant enhances user interaction by providing a seamless and intuitive experience through speech recognition and text-to-speech conversion.

Features:
Speech Recognition: Captures audio commands from users and converts them into text.
Natural Language Processing: Processes the text using OpenAI's GPT model to generate meaningful responses.
Text-to-Speech Conversion: Converts the generated responses back into speech for audio output.
Web Browsing: Opens specific websites based on user commands

Requirements:
Python 3.x
openai library
speech_recognition library
pyttsx3 library
webbrowser library
